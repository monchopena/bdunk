summary: How to work with Wordpress like an API and Angular JS like a Frontend
---

I made an Application in Angular JS based on this [template][template].

Because is a Blog I wanted to use Wordpress like an API.

This is the [result][wp_angular_demo].

## Why this?

1) My first reason is progressing with Angular JS.

2) I have been working for years with WP and I don't like the structure of the themes.

3) There is an excellent theme named AngularJS for [WordPress][wp_angular_theme], but includes PHP.

4) Web goes faster.

If you like it you can see code from [github][github_wp_angular].
